## Quick start

1) Download and install Steampipe (https://steampipe.io/downloads). Or use Brew:

```shell
brew tap turbot/tap
brew install steampipe

steampipe -v
steampipe version 0.11.2
```

2) Install the Terraform plugin:

```shell
steampipe plugin install terraform
```

3) Configure your Terraform creds: [Instructions](https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins/turbot/terraform#configuration)

`vi ~/.steampipe/config/terraform.spc`
```hcl
connection "terraform" {
  plugin = "terraform"
  paths  = ["/path/to/my/tf/files/*"]
}
```

4) Clone this repo and step into the directory:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-mod-terraform-aws-compliance.git
cd steampipe-mod-terraform-aws-compliance
```

5) Run the checks:

```shell
steampipe check all
```

Run all benchmarks for a specific compliance framework using tags:

```shell
steampipe check all --tag gdpr=true
```

Run a benchmark:

```shell
steampipe check terraform_aws_compliance.benchmark.s3
```

Run a specific control:

```shell
steampipe check terraform_aws_compliance.control.s3_bucket_default_encryption_enabled
```

Use introspection to view the available controls:
```
steampipe query "select resource_name from steampipe_control;"
```
