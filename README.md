# Terraform AWS Compliance Mod for Steampipe

140+ compliance and security controls to test your Terraform AWS resources against security best practices prior to deployment in your AWS accounts.

Run checks in a dashboard:

Or in a terminal:

## Getting started

### Installation

Download and install Steampipe (https://steampipe.io/downloads). Or use Brew:

```sh
brew tap turbot/tap
brew install steampipe
```

Install the terraform plugin with [Steampipe](https://steampipe.io):

```sh
steampipe plugin install terraform
```

Clone:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-mod-terraform-aws-compliance.git
```

### Usage

By default, the Terraform plugin configuration loads Terraform configuration
files in your current working directory (CWD).

To get started, change your CWD to where your TF files are located:

```sh
cd /path/to/tf_files
```

Then set the `STEAMPIPE_WORKSPACE_CHDIR` environment variable to the mod directory so Steampipe knows where to load benchmarks from:

```sh
export STEAMPIPE_WORKSPACE_CHDIR=/path/to/steampipe-mod-terraform-aws-compliance
```

Start your dashboard server:

```sh
steampipe dashboard
```

By default, the dashboard interface will then be launched in a new browser
window at https://localhost:9194. From here, you can run benchmarks by
selecting one or searching for a specific one.

Instead of running benchmarks in a dashboard, you can also run them within your
terminal with the `steampipe check` command.

Run all benchmarks:

```sh
steampipe check all
```

Run all benchmarks for a specific compliance framework using tags:

```sh
steampipe check all --tag gdpr=true
```

Run a benchmark:

```sh
steampipe check terraform_aws_compliance.benchmark.s3
```

Run a specific control:

```sh
steampipe check terraform_aws_compliance.control.s3_bucket_default_encryption_enabled
```

When running checks from the CWD, you can also run the `steampipe dashboard` and `steampipe check` commands using the `--workspace-chdir` command line argument:

```sh
steampipe dashboard --workspace-chdir=/path/to/steampipe-mod-terraform-aws-compliance
steampipe check all --workspace-chdir=/path/to/steampipe-mod-terraform-aws-compliance
```

Different output formats are also available, for more information please see
[Output Formats](https://steampipe.io/docs/reference/cli/check#output-formats).

### Credentials

No credentials are required.

### Configuration

If you want to run benchmarks and controls across multiple directories
containing Terraform configuration files, they can be run from within the
`steampipe-mod-terraform-aws-compliance` mod directory after configuring the
Terraform plugin configuration:

```sh
vi ~/.steampipe/config/terraform.spc
```

```hcl
connection "terraform" {
  plugin = "terraform"
  paths  = ["/path/to/files/*.tf", "/path/to/nested/files/**/*.tf"]
}
```

After setting up your Terraform plugin configuration, navigate to the `steampipe-mod-terraform-aws-compliance` mod directory and start the dashboard server:

```sh
cd /path/to/steampipe-mod-terraform-aws-compliance
steampipe dashboard
```
