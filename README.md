deep analysis of your Terraform resources and test them against operations &
security best practices.

## Current Compliance Checks

TBD

## Quick start

1) Download and install Steampipe (https://steampipe.io/downloads). Or use Brew:

```shell
brew tap turbot/tap
brew install steampipe

steampipe -v
steampipe version 0.10.0
```

2) Install the Terraform plugin:

```shell
steampipe plugin install terraform
```

3) Configure your Terraform creds: [Instructions](https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins/turbot/terraform#configuration)

`vi ~/.steampipe/config/terraform.spc`
```hcl
connection "terraform" {
  plugin = "terraform"
  paths  = ["/path/to/my/tf/files/*"]
}
```

4) Clone this repo and step into the directory:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-mod-terraform-sherlock.git
cd steampipe-mod-terraform-sherlock
```

5) Run the checks:

```shell
steampipe check all
```

You can also run a specific controls by name:

```shell
steampipe check control.TBD
```

Use introspection to view the available controls:
```
steampipe query "select resource_name from steampipe_control;"
```
